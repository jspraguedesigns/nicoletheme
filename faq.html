                    <p>Session fees cover my creativity and time, with all prints and products ordered separately.&nbsp; Signature Sessions are available on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and can be held in studio, at your home, or at the location of your choice, and lasts as long as you do <em>(typically 90 minutes)</em>! Other sessions are available throughout the week.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <h3><strong>Planning for your session</strong></h3>
                    <p>I prefer working in a casual and natural environment, where you and your child feel comfortable and at ease. I work in or around your home, or at a location of your choice. Working in a familiar environment allows your child to relax and be his/herself. This then allows me to capture images that truly represent your child. My service area is within 20 miles of my Mount Laurel, NJ. Beyond that, a Distance/Travel Fee may apply. Distance/Travel Fees are non-refundable and are required at the time of booking. Please contact me for further details.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes a shoot will need to be rescheduled due to rain, snow or the sniffles. Please provide at least 24 hours notice whenever possible. Rescheduling will be a priority, but is subject to availability.</p>
                    <p>I can bring the studio to you– backdrop, lights, and all! A studio set-up is used upon request. Approximately 10-15 square feet is needed when the studio set-up is used.</p>
                    <p>I always photographs in both black and white and color, so there is no need to decide in advance. Digital capabilities allow for minor touch-ups, so there’s no need to worry about a scratch or stain. I am always happy to discuss any ideas or questions you may have prior to your session. Feel free to <a href="http://58o.00a.myftpupload.com/contact-2/">contact me</a>!</p>

                    <h3><strong>What to wear for your session</strong></h3>
                    <p>Simple and comfortable! By staying with the basics for your clothing selections the focus is on you and not what you are wearing. Some clothing recommendations include overalls, jeans, khakis, solid color shirts, and simple dresses. Neutral colors are best. Please stay away from designs, logos &amp; words. In family or group settings, matching is not necessary—coordinate the group as one unit. Avoid mixing patterns and contrasting colors. If your child is going to wear shoes, try to choose shoes that do not have words, designs or lights on them. Whenever possible, bare feet are the best!</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h3><strong>Your Session</strong></h3>
                    <p>During the session, I will take the time to get to know your children so they feel comfortable and at ease. I’ll play with them and encourage them to be themselves. Standard location sessions are allotted 45 minutes. A fee may apply for sessions exceeding 45 minutes.</p>
                    <p>I request that only those to be photographed are present on the day of the session. The relationship your child establishes with me, and the interactions we share are important for a great shoot. Distractions can limit the success of the portrait session.</p>
                    <p>No other photographers, please!&nbsp; The results of the photo session are hugely dependent on the kids’ comfort level with me.&nbsp; I strive to allow your kids to forget they’re<em> “on the job,”</em> and just be themselves.&nbsp; A parent or grandparent with a camera will only hurt the process.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h3><strong>Maternity Sessions</strong></h3>
                    <p>This is one of the most exciting times in a woman’s life! It is a great honor to be able to take pictures of this extraordinary period. The main focus here is your belly. We suggest having black stretch pants and a black tank top or sports bra available for dramatic and fine art poses. Please remove watches in advance, as they often leave marks on wrists.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h3><strong>Newborn Sessions</strong></h3>
                    <p><a href="http://58o.00a.myftpupload.com/portfolio-2/newborn/">Newborns</a> are photographed using a studio light set-up either at your home. This allows the babies &amp; moms to be comfortable and relaxed. I often photograph the little ones in the nude. Accordingly, please prepare for the shoot by loosening or removing diapers and socks, as to avoid lines and marks on the baby’s skin. I recommend removing these items 30 minutes before the session. Family members to be photographed with the baby should wear clothing without any words or logos.&nbsp; Please allow at least three hours for a newborn session.</p>

                    <h3><strong>6 Month Old Sessions</strong></h3>
                    <p>Sitting up tall and proud, your baby’s growing up so fast! Full of smiles and a new found confidence, this is a great stage to capture in your baby’s development.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h3><strong>9 Month Old Sessions</strong></h3>
                    <p>This is one of the most fun stages to capture of your baby’s first year! Clapping, laughing, and full of new tricks, this is the perfect stage to create an adorable collection of your baby’s dramatic expressions.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h3><strong>First Birthday Sessions</strong></h3>
                    <p>What a year it’s been! Your baby has transformed from a helpless sleepy infant to a standing, walking and talking adventure-seeker. Full of fun, mischief and curiosity, your baby is suddenly a real person, and will surely show off in front of the camera.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h3><strong>Child Sessions</strong></h3>
                    <p>Each year marks new milestones and such changes in your <a href="http://58o.00a.myftpupload.com/portfolio-2/children/">child’s</a> personality. They keep getting cuter, and interacting with the world around them in new and exciting ways. Annual photo sessions will chronicle your child’s development and leave you with cherished memories you’ll have forever.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h3><strong>Family Sessions</strong></h3>
                    <p>You take hundreds of photos of your kids every week, but don’t you want to look back and see that you were there, too? Let me capture the love that you share as a family, the interactions that warm your heart, and the pride you feel in your family with a beautiful portrait you can display in your home or on this year’s holiday card!</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h3><strong>Pet Sessions</strong></h3>
                    <p>Pets are people too! I know that in some cases, the pets are the favorites and often the cutest members of your family – so why not give them the same love and attention that you’d give to your kids? Bring your furry pall into our studio, or invite me into your home to show your best friend just how much they mean to you.</p>
